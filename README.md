# Universal Pause Command

A **Stardew Valley** mod that allows all players in a multiplayer game to use the `/pause` and `/resume` commands, not
just the host. The pause functionality can also be triggered using a configurable keybind, set via **Generic Mod Config
Menu**.

## Features

- **Pause/Resume for All Players**: The `/pause` and `/resume` commands are available to all players, not just the host.
- **Customizable Keybind**: By default, the pause key is set to `P`, but you can configure it using **Generic Mod Config
  Menu**.

## Install

1. Install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download the mod from the [releases page](https://github.com/HarkushaVlad/UniversalPauseCommand/releases)
   or [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30847) and place it in the `Stardew Valley/Mods` folder.
3. **Optional**: Install [Generic Mod Config Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5098) to configure the
   pause key. You can always change the keybind manually by editing the configuration file in the mod directory.
4. Launch the game with SMAPI.

## How to Use

1. **Not all players need to have the mod installed**. The pause functionality will still work for everyone, though
   players without the mod wonâ€™t see chat notifications about who activated the pause and cannot trigger the pause
   unless they are the host.
2. **Triggering Pause**: Use `/pause` to pause the game and `/resume` to resume it for all players or use the pause key.

## Compatibility

- Works with Stardew Valley 1.6 and later on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
